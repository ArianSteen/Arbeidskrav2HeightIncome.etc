## Høyde & Inntekt

Høyde og Inntekt

## Introduction

It has been claimed that the height of a person is one of the most deciding factors for the persons income. In this short paper we will investigate this assertion by using a dataset from the _National Longitudinal Study_ (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics). See `help(heights, package = modelr)`for details.

## Summary statistics

We start by grouping the heights in 8 intervals and report summary statistics.

```{r}
heights$heightInt <-cut(heights$height, breaks = 8)
kable(summary(heights[,1:4]))
kable(summary(heights[,5:9]))
```
